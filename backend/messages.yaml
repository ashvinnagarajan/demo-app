  - Her laugh — it’s not just joyful, it’s this beautiful echo of her mom and brother. Every time she laughs, it feels like home.
  - She sends sweet, thoughtful messages telling me what she appreciates about me — little reminders that I matter to her, and they always brighten my day.
  - She’s a fighter. She puts herself in uncomfortable situations on purpose — because she’s always growing, always becoming stronger. She’s faced her fears and conquered them.
  - She believes relationships and family are sacred — she treats the people she loves with deep care and intention, and it shows in everything she does.
  - Our time at the beach — there’s just something about those moments with her. The calm, the laughter, the quiet connection. It’s one of my favorite kinds of memories.
  - Her silly side — especially when she imitates me or my friends. It always makes me laugh, and reminds me how fun and light she makes life feel.
  - She notices the little things. Whether it’s my mood, a detail I mentioned offhand, or something small that matters to me — she picks up on it and shows she cares.
  - She brings me back to what matters. Even when life feels chaotic or I’m in my head, her presence is grounding — like a reminder to breathe and focus on love.
  - She inspires me to be better. Not by pushing or judging, but just by being who she is — someone brave, kind, and deeply human.
  - She’s fearless in her ambition — whether it’s working at Adobe or heading to Wharton for her MBA, she goes after what she wants with grace and confidence.
  - She’s rooted in where she came from — her love for Folsom and the deep friendships she’s kept from high school and college say so much about her loyalty and heart.
  - She makes food feel like an adventure. Even as a vegetarian, she’s always up for trying something new, and sharing a meal with her is never just about food — it’s about joy.
